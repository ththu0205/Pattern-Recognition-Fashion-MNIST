# **Pattern-Recognition-Fashion-MNIST**

## About Data
This lab aims to classify fashion items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using **Logistic Regression (LR)** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. Fashion-MNIST consists of `70,000 images` (28x28 pixels) belonging to 10 fashion categories. In addition to building models, the lab also explores the *"Curse of Dimensionality"* and applies *PCA/LDA* for feature reduction, analyzing their impact on model performance.

## Git Commit Message Rule
After performing the **`git add .`** command, the **`git commit`** message should follow this structure:

    git commit -m "[folder/file updated] - [task description]"

**Example:**
    
    git commit -m "Fashion_MNIST_Classifier/ItemClassification.ipynb - Reducing dimensions using PCA."

Task description should provide enough information for other members to understand what was updated or changed, e.g., fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring code.

After that, use the **`git push`** command to push into the GitHub repository.
